# 🥊 Boxing Timer (Cross-Platform App)

### Overview
A self-directed build demonstrating **full-stack development, UI design**, and **multi-platform deployment**.

Originally created as a personal training tool for boxing intervals, this project evolved into a fully packaged app designed to run seamlessly across **desktop and mobile** environments — including offline functionality and platform-specific optimization.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Desktop:** Electron, NSIS Installer
- **Mobile:** Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Backend / Build:** Node.js, Electron-Builder
- **Supporting Tools:** Service Workers, Audio API, Wake Lock API

---

### ⚙️ Key Features
- Offline operation via service workers and advanced caching strategies
- Platform-adaptive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Auto-update system and NSIS installer for Windows builds
- Custom audio alerts and wake-lock support for consistent round timing
- Unified codebase and build automation for multi-platform packaging

---

### 🧭 Development Process
1. **UI Design:** Minimalist React + Tailwind interface designed for both landscape and portrait modes.
2. **Core Functionality:** Configurable timer intervals and audible round transitions.
3. **Offline Capability:** Implemented caching, localStorage persistence, and service worker registration.
4. **Cross-Platform Builds:** Electron desktop packaging with auto-update integration; Android PWA deployment.
5. **Testing & Optimization:** Performance checks for wake-lock reliability, multi-device sound timing, and offline error recovery.

---

### 🧪 Outcome
This project demonstrates end-to-end technical execution — from concept and design through build automation and deployment. It reflects a strong understanding of **systems thinking, platform interoperability**, and **product-level polish** applicable to both analytics and decision-support tool development.
